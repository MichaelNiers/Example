## Example Project Creation

A provisional automation tool to create a new project.
Actually it works with __Selenium__ but I'll change that using the GitHub API.

## Installation:

`git clone "https://github.com/MichaelNiers/Example.git"
cd Example
source ~/.commands.sh`

Then go to new.py and set the username and password to be your username and password.
Also make sure to change all directories to your directories so it should be '/Users/<your username>/path/to/your/project'

## Usage

To run the script type 'new <name of your folder>'

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
